# That freaking superhero has been frequenting Udacity
# as his favorite boss battle fight stage. The 'Udacity'
# banner keeps breaking, and money is being wasted on
# repairs. This time, we need you to proceduralize the
# fixing process by building a machine to automatically
# search through debris and return the 'Udacity' banner
# to the company, and be able to similarly fix other goods.

# Write a Python procedure fix_machine to take 2 string inputs
# and returns the 2nd input string as the output if all of its
# characters can be found in the 1st input string and "Give me
# something that's not useless next time." if it's impossible.
# Letters that are present in the 1st input string may be used
# as many times as necessary to create the 2nd string (you
# don't need to keep track of repeat usage).


# TOOLS: # if statement
         # while loop
         # string operations

def fix_machine(debris, product):
    x = 0
    store_char = ""
    while x < len(product):
        if debris.find(product[x]) != -1:
            store_char = store_char + product[x]
        else:
            return "Give me something that's not useless next time."
        x = x + 1
    return store_char
